                            <p id="bio">Born and raised in a small town in Kwazulu Natal called Pietermaritzburg, a poor but humble background with all odds against me and my family, I had to face challenges daily and deal with them. At the tender young age of about
                                10, I had the opportunity of going out every morning, very early with my siblings to sell Samoosa's and Murukku that my mum had made.

                                <br> <br> With the money we made, we could buy bread, which our lunch was made from. Some days we had no sales, which meant no lunch. During the latter part of my school years, I worked part time as a PA (PA = Petrol Attendant/Bowser
                                Boy) and at a grocery store to earn extra cash to help my family. In 1989, I completed my Grade 12 but did not pass. It was a horrible time for me and I almost cost myself my life. I then had to face reality, people and
                                the world. Thank God that within my community, people did not bother much about my situation as they had their own problems.<br> <br>

                                <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">

                                    I slowly realised that I needed to be thankful and grateful,
                                    as it was a lesson well learnt. Besides, my parents did not
                                    have the funds for me to further my education, life was tough and this would
                                    have drained them more. God has always been by my side, the same year I got
                                    employment at Lipton Tea as a Packer/Sweeper. I took on
                                    the job with open arms just to get a salary and help my parents. I DID WHAT
                                    IT TOOK! It was here that I began to realise that this is not what I wanted
                                    to do for the rest of my Life. The tough conditions made
                                    me stronger and more motivated to do BETTER with my Life. I started working
                                    extra time to get more money and study while working. This lead to me moving
                                    between various positions within the company until I transferred
                                    to Unilever Boksburg in the year 2000 as a Technical Engineering Buyer. <br><br>

                                    This was a Game Changer for me, I worked extremely hard and self-studied which
                                    lead to me getting one of the highest qualifications in
                                    the IT world...I became SAP Certified, all on my own hard work and
                                    perseverance. The reason why I say this was a Game Changer is that it
                                    allowed me to leave my comfort zone as a permanent employee into a
                                    contractual role, yes working for myself. <br> <br>

                                    This also got tough at times but the freedom
                                    outweighed anything else. Prior to me being SAP Certified, I also got my
                                    Production Management and Purchasing/Supply Management Diploma’s.
                                    I was still not satisfied and had loads of energy in ME! I decided to
                                    venture further into the MLM - Multi-Level Marketing space and was
                                    successful in the three programs I did. They say Life happens and YES,
                                    it brought me down to size once again in 2015 when I had no work for over a
                                    year and a half. This was one of my biggest life challenges ever as I found
                                    myself unable to provide for my family. <br> <br>

                                    This was tough and I pressurised myself even further because I felt hopeless. I
                                    thank God
                                    for my wife Seema who has been a pillar of strength and support to me, and
                                    my children who stood by me during this time. The biggest
                                    lesson I learnt from this was that when you fall down...lying on your
                                    back...you are still looking up to the sky and one should not give up so
                                    easily. I decided I AM NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP! I kept my prayer
                                    and my sanity intact, and started to pick myself up again. In 2015, I also
                                    founded #straighttalkwithnolan but did not do much with it although I had
                                    the time. <br> <br>

                                    I had the ideas and the plan with the project but
                                    had no heart for some reason to pursue it. Life did get better, I was called
                                    by a friend and offered at position at one of the biggest companies globally
                                    ABInBEV. I accepted the opportunity because I needed to put food on the table and
                                    make sure my family has a place they can call
                                    home. Forward wind to 2018, #straighttalkwithnolan is back in action and
                                    will be officially launching in January 2019.

                                    <br> <br>
                                    This is the most exciting project I have ever worked on because it allows me to work
                                    on
                                    MYSELF first and then help others work on THEMSELVES! This program is based
                                    on the daily challenges we face and how we can handle them
                                    better. We are all individuals in our own right and we owe it to ourselves
                                    to be the best version of ourselves. No one is going to change our
                                    mind-sets, we have to adapt and make the decision alone. This is
                                    where my program will help you make those hard felt decisions. <br> <br>

                                            My Mt Kilimanjaro journey - Scaling the heights of success! Summitting Africa's highest point and the World's highest free-standing mountain was no easy challenge, but the quest to raise awareness and funding for girls who are in need of sanitary pads
                                            was well worth the training and the risk of our lives. The journey was done as part of the Trek-4-Mandela expedition, in partnership with Imbumba Foundation. Our journey started on the 13th July and ended on
                                            Tata Madiba's birthday. Summit night meant leaving camp at 11pm on the 17th July and summitting at 10:30am on Madiba's birthday. That meant 11 and a half hours of walking in the cold, windy night until sunrise
                                            he next morning. The feeling overall was priceless. Mission accomplished.

                                            what they can do. The truth, however, is that you are far greater than you think and have truly amazing potential. The key is to tap into your higher self and unleash your full capacity for success and happiness.

                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I'm Pranisha, 34 years and mother to 2 wonderful girls. I am currently a teacher, teaching Chinese people how to speak English. I had also taught at schools both primary and secondary. Teaching was never ever a thought
                                        of mine, in fact I wanted to go into corporate or be a police officer. Before this stage of my life, I went through a very turbulent phase in my life which started in my early 20s going up to the age of 30. This
                                        was due to life choices that I made and also, I felt I was just attracting bad things to happen to me. I have been through heavy depressions, suicidal behavior (before my children were born), and neglecting myself
                                        which caused my life to become stagnant. At this time, I was working for a cellular company which basically wore me down and was not bringing me any joy. This is when I met my then husband, married and had my two
                                        girls. I felt no joy in my life even after marriage due to marital problems which resulted in a failed marriage that just added to my depression. I had left work when my little one was born, and life was not easy
                                        as finances were running out. I was filled with so much negativity and felt that there was this huge void in me, and I cried every day, especially now with a marriage that turn toxic and was becoming abusive. Living
                                        in misery for so long, I looked at my children and realized I need to make a change for them to show them what they need to be happy. The first thing I did was separate from a toxic relationship, so I left. The
                                        next step required me to change my whole mindset, to train my mind to see the good and be positive. This required me to do things that will empower me and help me mentally. I started exercising, partaking in races,
                                        stopping myself from any negative thoughts and building myself up physically and mentally. It was in this time that I realized that I wanted to also do something to also motivate and advise others in helping them
                                        out of their depressions. So, I decided to become a teacher as I felt that this was the best platform to make a difference. I then started studying again and got a job as an online teacher which helped so much.
                                        4 years down the line this year I graduated with my degree and being a single mum to my kids. The moral of my story is that anything can be achieved when you are determined, and when you are determined there is
                                        no option for failure. The energy you put out is what you get back so if you are positive and see the good in everything and learn from the bad, you will be able to pick yourself up every time and make yourself
                                        a better person. Any situation even if it's one that you feel where you are sinking so deep and can’t get out, you can get out and turn it around. I have just given you a mild version of my story because there have
                                        been disturbing times but all it does is make you stronger. I am not where I want to be, but I'm very far from where I used to be, I have never felt more happier with myself. I have built myself up and am teaching
                                        my children how to do so too and now that I'm in my best place to date, I want to help others and take them out of their dark and difficult times and help them realize that they have all the power inside of them.
                                        Thank you

                                        Resources and work for 6 years as an events and marketing co coordinator at Coca Cola Namibia Beverages’ before I relocated to SA in 1997. I still do have family and lots of friends that keep me grounded. I’ve worked

                                    <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Life has challenged me so much, I am a young man who has faced a lot in life. I have a lot to tell but I will be brief. When I was a young boy, I lost four family members my father, mother, brother and older sister
                                        within the period of 5 years. I did not get a foster care or social grant due to family conflicts.Me and my young sister, we did not have any income in our home, but we had to take care of my older sister's children
                                        that she left when she died. My young sister had to look for a job so that we could eat.It was very hard for me to continue with the school because I had to beg for the school uniform from other children, knowing
                                        that you will go to school hungry and come back still not having something to eat is very hard. Some days we were going to bed without eating anything.I decided that I will finish the school and go to look for jobs
                                        because I am the only hope my family has. After getting better result in my matric I went to WITS university to do computer science that where I met the guy called Nolan. when I met Nolan, I was: Afraid of facing
                                        the real world I thought I was not strong enough, I was confused about my life I did not know if I should go for jobs so that I can put a bread in the table for my family or must I continue with school. I was afraid
                                        to tell my family that I do not like computer science because they thought It the best career for me. I had the low self- esteem and low self-confidence I thought I could not speak English as I learnt in rural Areas.
                                        Nolan was my internet with all answers I needed, he showed me the little bright side of my life. Even now I am still moving because he keeps on chasing me, he keeps on motivating me that why I am still moving. I
                                        am a better person and I decided to go on with my education, I am living a positive life now and I can help others. I am using Nolan’s daily quotes to face daily challenges, they are very powerful. NOLAN DONT GO
                                        AWAY MAN, I STILL NEED YOU…

                                    <p>PD Devnarain is a practising Reiki Master and Healer for the last 12 years. Her spiritual journey began at a young age when she became aware of the existence of a spiritual realm outside of the 3rd dimension through
                                        various incidents which could only be explained as supernatural ones. Following the path of light and healing, PD`s healing work began with her study of Reiki – a Japanese technique which brings about changes ranging
                                        from merely a deep sense of relaxation all the way to profound existential changes in the lives of one`s clients. Additional research, studies and personal experiences in spirituality over the years have taught
                                        her how to bring about a new form of conscious healing within clients in conjunction with the various modalities that she works with. PD also holds a Communications Degree, majoring in Communications, English and
                                        Psychology. She is also an entrepreneur who owns a PR, Marketing and Communications company called PR Divas, based in Johannesburg, South Africa.

                                        <p>Born and raised in a small town in Kwazulu Natal called Pietermaritzburg, a
                                            poor but humble background with all odds against me and my family, I had to
                                            face challenges daily and deal with them. At the tender young
                                            age of about 10, I had the opportunity of going out every morning, very
                                            early with my siblings to sell Samoosa's and Murukku that my mum had made.
                                            With the money we made, we could buy bread, which our lunch
                                            was made from. Some days we had no sales, which meant no lunch. During the
                                            latter part of my school years, I worked part time as a PA (PA = Petrol
                                            Attendant/Bowser Boy) and at a grocery store to earn extra cash
                                            to help my family. In 1989, I completed my Grade 12 but did not pass. It was
                                            a horrible time for me and I almost cost myself my life. I then had to face
                                            reality, people and the world. Thank God that within my
                                            community, people did not bother much about my situation as they had their
                                            own problems. I slowly realised that I needed to be thankful and grateful,
                                            as it was a lesson well learnt. Besides, my parents did not
                                            have the funds for me to further my education, life was tough and this would
                                            have drained them more. God has always been by my side, the same year I got
                                            employment at Lipton Tea as a Packer/Sweeper. I took on
                                            the job with open arms just to get a salary and help my parents. I DID WHAT
                                            IT TOOK! It was here that I began to realise that this is not what I wanted
                                            to do for the rest of my Life. The tough conditions made
                                            me stronger and more motivated to do BETTER with my Life. I started working
                                            extra time to get more money and study while working. This lead to me moving
                                            between various positions within the company until I transferred
                                            to Unilever Boksburg in the year 2000 as a Technical Engineering Buyer. This
                                            was a Game Changer for me, I worked extremely hard and self-studied which
                                            lead to me getting one of the highest qualifications in
                                            the IT world...I became SAP Certified, all on my own hard work and
                                            perseverance. The reason why I say this was a Game Changer is that it
                                            allowed me to leave my comfort zone as a permanent employee into a
                                            contractual
                                            role, yes working for myself. This also got tough at times but the freedom
                                            outweighed anything else. Prior to me being SAP Certified, I also got my
                                            Production Management and Purchasing/Supply Management Diploma’s.
                                            I was still not satisfied and had loads of energy in ME! I decided to
                                            venture further into the MLM - Multi-Level Marketing space and was
                                            successful in the three programs I did. They say Life happens and YES,
                                            it brought me down to size once again in 2015 when I had no work for over a
                                            year and a half. This was one of my biggest life challenges ever as I found
                                            myself unable to provide for my family. This was tough
                                            and I pressurised myself even further because I felt hopeless. I thank God
                                            for my wife Seema who has been a pillar of strength and support to me, and
                                            my children who stood by me during this time. The biggest
                                            lesson I learnt from this was that when you fall down...lying on your
                                            back...you are still looking up to the sky and one should not give up so
                                            easily. I decided I AM NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP! I kept my prayer
                                            and my sanity intact, and started to pick myself up again. In 2015, I also
                                            founded #straighttalkwithnolan but did not do much with it although I had
                                            the time. I had the ideas and the plan with the project but
                                            had no heart for some reason to pursue it. Life did get better, I was called
                                            by a friend and offered at position at one of the biggest companies globally
                                            ABInBEV. I accepted the opportunity because I needed
                                            to put food on the table and make sure my family has a place they can call
                                            home. Forward wind to 2018...#straighttalkwithnolan is back in action and
                                            will be officially launching in January 2019. This is the
                                            most exciting project I have ever worked on because it allows me to work on
                                            MYSELF first and then help others work on THEMSELVES! This program is based
                                            on the daily challenges we face and how we can handle them
                                            better. We are all individuals in our own right and we owe it to ourselves
                                            to be the best version of ourselves. No one is going to change our
                                            mind-sets, we have to adapt and make the decision alone. This is
                                            where my program will help you make those hard felt decisions. I have been
                                            involved in many self-development programs like Millionaire Mind Intensive,
                                            Enlightened Warrior Power, Train the Trainer and often attend
                                            motivational talks. Now is the time to give back to Africa. My Mission and
                                            Vision: To Change Lives in Africa and then Globally through Education,
                                            Knowledge and Empowerment. My Personal Motto – Go Forth and Conquer!</p>

                                        Clinic. (for Epilepsy) He was enthusiastic and eager
                                        to learn more in his Mathematics and Physical Science Lessons. No wonder that in our
                                        last revision before the final exam, he topped the class. I strongly believe that
                                        this mentorship course helped motivate him, in life
